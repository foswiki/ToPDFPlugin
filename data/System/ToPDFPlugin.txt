---+ !ToPDF Plugin
 This plugin converts Foswiki topics into PDF`s. Comparing to !GenPDF or others, its main goal yet is to support CSS as far as possible and therefore the PDF should just look like the original topic. In addition it supports to render the topic in a diffrrent template before generating the PDF to customize the topic, remove anything not needed or just adjust the "printing" view for papers.

The plugin fetches all data ( pictures, css ..) on file-system base and save a lot of webserver-load now.

This Plugin was based on !GenPDF

*This plugin is currently not able to display patter-skin topics correctly. See !ToDo/Bug section below*

---++ Usage
